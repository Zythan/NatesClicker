# Nate's Clicker
Named after my Grandson Nate.

This my version of How to make an incremental/clicker game tutorial by Tanktot Games on youtube

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTwruuVAqlEvj8QxTFdVPc6_AwpgF2w

Tutorial Code up to lesson 7 is in the Original branch if you would like to see where this started.

pyserver.bat needs python installed to work in a windows system.
Any webserver will do for the save of the game data to the browser cache.
